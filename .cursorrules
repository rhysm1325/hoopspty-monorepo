# Cursor Rules for HoopsPty Monorepo

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing multiple HoopsPty business applications:

- `apps/finance-dashboard/` - AUSA Finance Dashboard (Xero integration)
- `apps/website/` - Public marketing website (planned)
- `apps/admin-portal/` - Business admin portal (planned)
- `apps/tours-booking/` - Customer booking system (planned)

## Shared Packages

- `packages/shared-ui/` - Reusable UI components
- `packages/shared-types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `packages/shared-auth/` - Authentication utilities
- `packages/shared-utils/` - Utility functions
- `packages/xero-integration/` - Xero API integration

## Development Guidelines

### Monorepo Rules
- Use shared packages instead of duplicating code
- Keep app-specific logic in the respective app folder
- Extract reusable components to `packages/shared-ui/`
- Extract common types to `packages/shared-types/`

### Testing Rules
- Maintain high test coverage for shared packages (95%+)
- Test shared components thoroughly as they're used across apps
- Run tests at both app and package level

### Import Guidelines
- Import shared packages using `@hoops-pty/package-name`
- Prefer importing from shared packages over duplicating code
- Keep internal app imports using relative paths

### Git Workflow
- Prefix commits with app name when app-specific: `finance: add new dashboard`
- Use `shared:` prefix for shared package changes: `shared: update auth utilities`
- Use `monorepo:` prefix for structure changes: `monorepo: add new app scaffold`

## Deployment

Each app deploys independently to Vercel:
- Finance Dashboard → `apps/finance-dashboard/` root directory
- Website → `apps/website/` root directory (when created)
- Admin Portal → `apps/admin-portal/` root directory (when created)

## Quality Standards

All apps must pass:
- TypeScript compilation with no errors
- ESLint with no errors
- All tests passing
- 95%+ coverage for financial calculations and shared utilities

Run `npm run quality` at root to check all apps and packages.
