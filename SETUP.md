# HoopsPty Monorepo Setup Guide

## 🎉 Restructuring Complete!

Your HoopsPty project has been successfully restructured into a modern monorepo with the following benefits:

### ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Monorepo Structure Created**
   - `apps/` - All applications
   - `packages/` - Shared code packages  
   - `tools/` - Development tools
   - `docs/` - Documentation

2. **AUSA Finance Dashboard Moved**
   - From `ausa-finance-dashboard/` → `apps/finance-dashboard/`
   - Updated package.json with shared package references
   - Created Vercel deployment configuration

3. **Shared Packages Created**
   - `@hoops-pty/shared-ui` - UI components
   - `@hoops-pty/shared-types` - TypeScript types
   - `@hoops-pty/shared-auth` - Authentication utilities
   - `@hoops-pty/shared-utils` - Utility functions
   - `@hoops-pty/xero-integration` - Xero API integration

4. **Future Apps Scaffolded**
   - `apps/website/` - Marketing website (placeholder)
   - `apps/admin-portal/` - Admin portal (placeholder)
   - `apps/tours-booking/` - Booking system (placeholder)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/rhysmurphy/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/CursorProjects/HoopsPty
npm install
```

### 2. Test Finance Dashboard
```bash
npm run dev:finance
```

### 3. Verify Structure
```bash
# Check all packages
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm test

# Check quality
npm run quality
```

## 🏗️ Ready for Multi-App Development

You can now:

1. **Deploy Finance Dashboard Independently**
   - Vercel project: Root directory = `apps/finance-dashboard/`
   - Domain: `finance.yourdomain.com`

2. **Create New Apps**
   - Copy structure from `apps/finance-dashboard/`
   - Reference shared packages with `@hoops-pty/package-name`
   - Deploy to separate Vercel projects

3. **Share Code Efficiently**
   - Extract common components to `packages/shared-ui/`
   - Share types via `packages/shared-types/`
   - Reuse auth logic from `packages/shared-auth/`
