  - Fact table transformation framework (sales, payments, inventory, cash flow)
  - Incremental processing support for performance
  - Data quality validation during transformation
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

- **5.2 Revenue stream tagging using admin-configured mappings** ✅

  - Account code to revenue stream mappings
  - Item code to revenue stream mappings
  - Automated invoice tagging based on line item analysis
  - Confidence scoring for revenue stream assignments
  - Priority-based stream resolution for mixed invoices
  - Configuration validation and completeness checking

### 6.0 Configuration Management System ✅
- **Revenue stream mapping interface** ✅
  - Database tables for all configuration types
  - Revenue stream mappings with account and item code arrays
  - Individual account and item mappings with categorization
  - GST method configuration (Accrual vs Cash)
  - Deferred revenue rules for Tours business
  - Configuration summary and validation functions

## Key Infrastructure Improvements

### Database Schema Enhancements
- Added comprehensive data integrity checking functions
- Created configuration management tables with RLS policies
- Implemented automated revenue stream tagging functions
- Added performance indexes for analytics queries
- Enhanced staging tables with revenue stream columns

### API and Server Actions
- Secure sync operations through Next.js Server Actions
- Role-based access control for all sync operations
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Audit logging for all administrative actions

### UI Components
- Modern sync monitoring dashboard with real-time updates
- Badge variants for status indicators (success, warning, error)
- Data tables with export capabilities
- Role-based navigation and access controls

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Xero API** → **MCP Server** → **Staging Tables** → **Validation** → **Analytics Tables** → **Dashboard**
2. **Configuration System** applies revenue stream tagging during transformation
3. **Data Integrity Checks** run automatically and on-demand
4. **Analytics Pipeline** processes data for business intelligence

### Security Model
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all configuration tables
- Role-based access control (Owner, Finance, Operations, Sales, Marketing)
- Secure server-side API operations only
- Audit logging for all administrative actions

### Performance Optimizations
- Incremental sync with If-Modified-Since headers
- Circuit breaker pattern for API reliability
- Intelligent rate limiting and backoff
- Database indexes for analytics queries
- Cached data for fallback scenarios
